# Project Omega – Text Adventure Game

## Game Overview

**Project Omega** is a text-based adventure game set in a secret scientific laboratory after a major accident. The laboratory is partially abandoned, toxic gas is spreading, and the security system is locked.

The game is played by typing simple text commands such as `go north`, `take item`, or `use item`. No programming knowledge is required to play.

## Player Goal

To successfully complete the game, the player must:

* Reactivate the **Main Server**
* Find and take the **Antidote**
* Reach the **Emergency Exit**
* Achieve a minimum score of **150 points**

If the player reaches the exit with all required items but has fewer than 150 points, the game is also lost.

## What the Player Has

During the game, the player can:

* Explore different locations connected by corridors
* Collect and manage items using an inventory
* Use key cards to unlock restricted areas
* Wear a Hazmat Suit to protect against toxic gas
* Interact with characters and read documents
* Earn or lose points based on actions and decisions

Some locations contain hazardous gas and will reduce the player’s score if entered without proper protection.
